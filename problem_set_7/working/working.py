Whereas most countries use a 24-hour clock, the United States tends to use a 12-hour clock. Accordingly, instead of “09:00 to 17:00”, many Americans would say they work “9:00 AM to 5:00 PM” (or “9 AM to 5 PM”), wherein “AM” is an abbreviation for “ante meridiem” and “PM” is an abbreviation for “post meridiem”, wherein “meridiem” means midday (i.e., noon).

In a file called working.py, implement a function called convert that expects a str in either of the 12-hour formats below and returns the corresponding str in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no periods therein) and that there will be a space before each. Assume that these times are representative of actual times, not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.

9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
9 AM to 5 PM
Raise a ValueError instead if the input to convert is not in either of those formats or if either time is invalid (e.g., 12:60 AM, 13:00 PM, etc.). But do not assume that someone’s hours will start ante meridiem and end post meridiem; someone might work late and even long hours (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM).
