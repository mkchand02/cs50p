“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, “at least it’s all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too.” She pointed her wand at Hedwig’s cage. “Scourgify.” A few feathers and droppings vanished.

— Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
Data, too, often needs to be “cleaned,” as by reformatting it, so that values are in a consistent, if not more convenient, format. Consider, for instance, this CSV file of students, before.csv, below:
#####
name,house
"Abbott, Hannah",Hufflepuff
...
#####
Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_characters

In a file called scourgify.py, implement a program that:

Expects the user to provide two command-line arguments:
the name of an existing CSV file to read as input, whose columns are assumed to be, in order, name and house, and
the name of a new CSV to write as output, whose columns should be, in order, first, last, and house.
Converts that input to that output, splitting each name into a first name and last name. Assume that each student will have both a first name and last name.
If the user does not provide exactly two command-line arguments, or if the first cannot be read, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
